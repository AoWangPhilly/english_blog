                <h2 class="subtitle">Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Beginning the 19th century sparked the transition of the Classical era to the Romantic era thanks to
                    the rebel Beethoven. His music broke through the Classical's traditions in length and form. However,
                    many of the Viennese society thought it bizarre, but as a rebel - he redefined what symphonies ought
                    to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much like another rebel, Nia Nal from Supergirl, made the U.S., going through an anti-alien era,
                    full of xenophobic radicalization, believe that both aliens and humans can live in peace. And much
                    like Beethoven, she overcame her conflicts of self-doubt and embraced her powers to take up the
                    mantle of Dreamer.
                </p>

                <p>Before moving on, the hero's journey shouldn't be used as a template for all stories. Therefore we
                    shouldn't think Eroica and Dreamer should match it exactly, but as it's a way to analyze these two
                    great works and how they relate and differ from each other.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content is-medium">
                <h2 class="subtitle">Status Quo</h2>
                <p>Ludwig van Beethoven was a German pianist and composer, whom many consider being the most significant
                    musical geniuses in history. At age seven, he gave his first public piano performance. However, he
                    started losing his hearing at age 26, but from that struggle came many beautiful arts of work, such
                    as Eroica.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dreamer is the first transgender superhero on television. However, she wasn't always a superhero;
                    she was Nia Nal, a political speechwriter in Washington, D.C. for the White House Press Secretary,
                    Cat Grant. She later moved to National City to learn from Kara Danvers, Supergirl, to become a
                    reporter.
                </p>
                <h2 class="subtitle">Markings of a Hero</h2>
                <p>
                    But even as a rising reporter and without even realizing she had powers, she stood up to anti-alien
                    supporters. When Brainy was ordering pizzas from a shop owner he thought was his friend, his image
                    inducer, the device that makes him look human, was hacked.
                </p>
                <p> After Brainy's reveal, the pizza shop owner attempted to attack him with a steel baseball bat. Nia
                    defended him, reminded in how Aliens and trans were discriminated against, and stood up, holding a
                    mirror to their faces, showing they, themselves are traitors.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">Call to Adventure</h2>

                    alt="The hobbit door">
                <p>
                    In the Call to Adventure, the quest often passes through an unfamiliar, special world, but always
                    starts and ends in the ordinary one. Strangely, the scenario is the reverse. She's returning to her
                    hometown, Parthas, Irish, for paradise, "where aliens and humans lived together in harmony for
                    decades," for the Harvest Fest.</p>

                <p>Nia sees her family and sister against but tries to mask her dreaming powers from them, asking Kara
                    to not even mentioning it to her family due to her sister eagerly waiting for her abilities to
                    arrive. The powers are passed down matrilineally; only one daughter can receive the power. Yet, her
                    sister has devoted her life, assuming she would receive it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content is-medium">
                <h2 class="subtitle">Trials</h2>
                <img src="https://www.linkinglines.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/challenges-1080x675.jpg"
                    alt="Man pushing boulder up">
                <p>There aren't a lot of similarities between the two individuals until the trials. In Eroica's Second
                    Movement, titled "Funeral March," Beethoven creates an ambiance of grief and sadness, with the oboe
                    solo, in the beginning, tying off the private pain he must've felt alone. And it evokes these
                    feelings since it was years before he wrote Eroica that he was going deaf. He felt terror and shame,
                    trying to keep it a secret, as what kind of a musician is not able to hear?
                </p>
                <p>The second movement also matches with Nia's storyline since it's just when her mother finds out that
                    she inherited the Dreamer power and dies. However, when her sister found out, she stated how it's
                    her fault since she should've gotten the Dreamer power already since her powers should've come by
                    now. And she could've saved her.
                </p>
                <p>Nia is conflicted with both grief and guilt from her mother's death and hiding that she had it -
                    though encouraging that her sister would get it ONE DAY. But imagine the layered shame, thinking if
                    I were like my sister, studying how to interpret dreams and being serious about the powers, I
                    could've saved my mother. </p>
                <video controls="controls" src="videos/part2.mov"></video>
                <p>However, her sister does end up finding out.</p>
                <p>
                    Although it's clear that Nia's mother died, I feel that, internally, she lost both a part of her
                    mother and sister. Much like, who died in Beethoven's Funeral March was himself, internally. </p>

                <img src="https://images.assetsdelivery.com/compings_v2/osmanpek/osmanpek1501/osmanpek150100015.jpg"
                    alt="Helping hands">
                <p>Unlike Dreamer's assistance, which was Supergirl and Brainy helping her to become a superhero,
                    Beethoven
                    didn't have that luxury. But I think it was more of the Heiligenstadt environment and his own love
                    for
                    music that was assistance. In it self, possibly one's own inner-strength can be accounted as
                    assistance
                    in the hero's journey.</p>
