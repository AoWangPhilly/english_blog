                <h2 class="subtitle">Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Beginning the 19th century sparked the transition of the Classical era to the Romantic era thanks
                    to the rebel Ludwig van Beethoven. It broke through the Classical’s traditions in length and form.
                    However, many of the Viennese society thought it bizarre, but as a rebel - he made them rethink what
                    a symphony should be and do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much like another rebel, Nia Nal, or Dreamer from Supergirl,
                    made a nation, much like the U.S., going through an anti-alien era, full of xenophobic
                    radicalization, believe that both aliens and humans can live in peace. And much like Beethoven, she
                    overcame her conflicts of self-doubt and embraced her powers to take up the mantle.
                </p>

                <p>Before moving on, the hero’s journey shouldn’t be used as a template for all stories. Therefore we
                    shouldn’t think Eroica and Dreamer should match it exactly, but as it’s a way to analyze these two
                    great works and how they relate and differ from each other. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content is-medium">
                <h2 class="subtitle">Status Quo</h2>
                <p>
                    Nia Nal moved to National City to learn from Kara Danvers, Supergirl, to become a
                    reporter. But even as a rising reporter and without even realizing she had powers, she stood up to
                    anti-alien supporters. When Brainy was ordering pizzas from a shop owner he thought was his friend,
                    his image inducer, the device that makes him look human, was hacked.
                </p>
                <p> After Brainy was revealed, the
                    pizza shop owner attempted to attack him with a steel baseball bat. Nia defended him, being reminded
                    how Aliens and trans were discriminated against and stood up and held a mirror to their faces,
                    showing they, themselves are traitors.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="content is-medium">
                <h2 class="subtitle">Call to Adventure</h2>
                <p>
                    In the Call to Adventure, the quest often passes through an unfamiliar, special world, but always
                    starts
                    and ends in the ordinary one. She returns to her hometown, Parthas, Irish, for paradise, “where
                    aliens
                    and humans lived together in harmony for decades,” for the Harvest Fest.</p>

                <p>Nia sees her family and sister
                    against but tries to mask her dreaming powers from them, asking Kara to not even mentioning it to
                    her
                    family due to her sister eagerly waiting for her abilities to arrive. The powers are passed down
                    matrilineally; only one daughter can receive the power. Her sister has devoted her life, assuming
                    she
                    would accept it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content is-medium">
                <h2 class="subtitle">Assistance</h2>
                Unlike Dreamer's assistance, which was Supergirl and Brainy helping her to become a superhero, Beethoven
                didn't have that luxury. But I think it was more of the Heiligenstadt environment and his own love for
                music that was assistance. In it self, possibly one's own inner-strength can be accounted as assistance
                in the hero's journey.
